# 🐍 Python Basics: Printing and Variables

## 🎯 Learning Intentions
- Display text using `print()`
- Use variables to store and display data
- Reassign variables and format output neatly

---

### 🧩 1. Displaying Text
```python
print("Hello World")
```

---

### 🏡 2. Display Personal Details
```python
print("Caroline")
print("Sydney")
print("30 October 2025")
```

---

### 🗣️ 3. Apostrophes and Triple Quotes
```python
print('''Don't forget your laptop.
Bob's car is red.
It's a sunny day.''')
```

---

### 📜 4. Multi-line Output
```python
print("""One
Two
Three""")
```

---

### 📦 5. Using Variables
```python
name = "Caroline"
print(name)
```

---

### 🏠 6. Combining Text and Variables
```python
roomNumber = 12
print("I am staying in room number", roomNumber)
```

---

### 💰 7. Reassigning Variables
```python
dollars = 50
print("I have", dollars, "dollars in my account.")

dollars = 120
print("But now I have", dollars, "dollars in my account.")
```

---

### 🧮 8. Printing Multiple Variables
```python
firstName = "Caroline"
age = 17
school = "Central High"

print(firstName, age, school)
print(f"{firstName} is {age} years old and goes to {school}.")
```

---

### 🧠 Reflection
- What does the `print()` function do?  
- Why are variables useful?  
- How does reassigning a variable change your program?

## Further Exercises
1. Write a program that stores your first name and favourite colour in variables, and prints a sentence like: 
*My name is Caroline and my favourite colour is blue.*

2. Use the escape character <code>\n</code> to print the following using one print command:
   <code>
   Monday
   Tuesday
   Wednesday
   Thursday
   Friday
    </code>

3. Print a sentence that includes emojis by using Unicode.
*Python is fun😊*
