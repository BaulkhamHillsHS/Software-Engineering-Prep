# üß≠ Getting Started ‚Äî Create Your GitHub Account & Run Your First Python Code

Welcome to your **first coding course using GitHub**! Follow these steps to get everything ready for your Python projects.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up** (top-right corner)
3. Choose:
   - A **username** you like (ensure it is school appropriate) OR if you already have an existing account, you can use that. 
   - Your **school email** (if possible)
   - A **strong password**
4. Verify your email address (check your inbox).

‚úÖ Done ‚Äî you now have your GitHub account!

Now come back this page for step 2.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Log in to GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based coding environment. It lets you code directly in the browser ‚Äî no installs needed!

1. Click the green **‚ÄúCode‚Äù** button, then **‚ÄúCreate codespace on main‚Äù**. OR click on the Codespace Badge.
   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/BaulkhamHillsHS/Software-Engineering-Prep?quickstart=1)
2. Wait for it to load ‚Äî it might take a couple of minutes.
3. You‚Äôll see a terminal at the bottom. This is your Python workspace. This is a fully functional Python IDE to complete this work.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run your first Python program

In the terminal, type:

```bash
python 
```

Then follow the prompt and see your output!

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Save and Commit Your Work

Each time you finish a lab:
1. Click **Source Control** (the third icon on the left).
2. Write a short message like `finished lab 01A`.
3. Click **Commit & Push**.

That saves your progress to GitHub automatically.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check your work (optional)

You can run tests anytime to see if your code works:

```bash
pytest -q
```

‚úÖ Green = success!  
‚ùå Red = try again!

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps

- Work through each folder in order (`01A`, then `01B`, etc.).
- Ask for help if your codespace doesn‚Äôt open or you see errors.
- Keep your repo tidy ‚Äî commit often, small steps.

Happy coding! üêç
